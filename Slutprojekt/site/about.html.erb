            Cyberpunk 2077 is an upcoming role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt. Adapted from the tabletop game Cyberpunk 2020, it is set fifty-seven years later in dystopian Night City, California, an open world in which a group known as Edgerunners serve society in eight different roles, which the player is free to choose and customise a character from. Player agency and choice lead to alternate endings.
